The main goal is to apply the learned notions during the OS course.
I am trying to make an interface for a robot connected to a Linux computer and to achieve the following:
 *activate this program when user connects via ssh
  #filter the ip addresses of incoming connections
  #limit the maximum connections form the same user or robot
  #provide info to the user on login
  #about the operating system
  #about the robot
 *use an infinite loop 
 *handle signals 
 *provide simple UI
 *manage updates and recompile the source (with program restart)
 *
